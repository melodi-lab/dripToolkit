<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>FASTA file format</H1>

<p>
Crux searches protein sequence databases given in FASTA format.  The
format is very simple. Every entry consists of a sequence identifier
(ID), an optional comment (COMMENT), and a sequence (SEQUENCE). The
format looks like this:
</p>

<pre>
  &gt;ID COMMENT
  SEQUENCE
</pre>

<p>
The special character "&gt;" marks the beginning of a new sequence.
The "&gt;" character is followed immediately by the sequence
identifier. The rest of that line is occupied by the optional
comment. Subsequent lines contain the sequence itself.
</p>

<p>Some rules about representing sequences:</p>

<ul>

<li>
A single protein sequence can span multiple lines.  The &gt; character
occurring at the beginning of the line indicates the end of the
sequence.</li>

<li>
Case doesn't matter. Crux Suite converts everything to uppercase.</li>

<li>
White space (spaces and newlines) within the sequence are
ignored.</li>

<li>
Characters should be from the amino acid alphabet, which contains
twenty characters for amino acids ("ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWY") and is
augmented by four more ambiguous characters ("BUXZ"):</li>

<pre>
    A  alanine                         P  proline
    B  aspartate or asparagine         Q  glutamine
    C  cystine                         R  arginine
    D  aspartate                       S  serine
    E  glutamate                       T  threonine
    F  phenylalanine                   U  any
    G  glycine                         V  valine
    H  histidine                       W  tryptophan
    I  isoleucine                      Y  tyrosine
    K  lysine                          Z  glutamate or glutamine
    L  leucine                         X  any
    M  methionine                      
    N  asparagine
</pre>

</ul>
